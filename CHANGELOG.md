## [0.3.0] - 2017-09-28
### Added
- Add the :!OR! operator - now you can specify multiple steps for a
  stage.
- Written relevant tests for this operator.

## [0.2.8] - 2017-04-07
### Fixed
- Fix a bug where a status is get-valued if there is a get-valued
  multi above even if it's not intended to.

## [0.2.7] - 2017-04-07
### Fixed
- Fix a bug in parser causing an error if there's a new step after a
  multi-capturing status clause in a rule: When there is a step(keyword) after a :multi, don't match, just set
  current-step and move on.
  
### Added
- Tests for step after multi

## [0.2.6] - 2017-04-02
### Added
- Add French and English common names dictionary look-up - we patch
  final Viterbi tagger results with this dictionary to ensure these
  names are detected.
- Add patching samples in tests file.
- Use tries to efficiently look up dictionaries - may change.

## [0.2.5] - 2017-03-22
### Changed
- Moved models out of resourcs into a specific folder, so they are not
  packaged in the jar - light in clojurescript(in which you'd use the
  namespaces)
- changed var names in model so they can be used easily in :refer.

### Fixed
- edn... etc in the tools.cljc - now only in clj. (use :refer)
- using :refer in core_tests.cljc

## [0.2.4] - 2017-03-21
### Fixed
- arg-max was no more referred to in tagger.cljc. Switched to
  arg-max-m.

### Added
- Two cljs friendly models as cljc namespaces: en_fn_model.cljc and
  fr_tb_model.cljc.
- core_test is now a cljc file.

## [0.2.3] - 2017-03-19
### Added 
- Annotated english corpus based on the [Framenet Project](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/).

## [0.2.1] - 2017-03-13
### Added
- Detailed workflow and references in Readme.

### Changed
- :optional-steps are now specified in the rules. No more passing in

  associated state as we work with Clojure maps - Simpler
  implementation and most of all - it works !
